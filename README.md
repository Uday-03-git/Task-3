# Task-3
In this project, I worked with an ecommerce dataset using SQL. I started by creating tables for customers, orders, products, and order items, then inserted sample data to simulate a real-world scenario. I used select, where, order by, and group by to filter, sort, and summarize the data. I performed inner and left joins to combine data across multiple tables. I also used subqueries and aggregate functions like sum and avg to analyze sales performance. I calculated running totals using window functions and identified customers who ordered more than one product. I updated product prices with a percentage increase and added a new column to categorize orders by their total value.
